To make the pipeline deploy NetworkStack, your GitHub repo must include:


network-stack.template.json


generated by:

cdk synth


-- Project status is:

[SOLVED] Pipeline trigered automatically when changes app.py and rebuilds the ECR image with the latest, but recently added
network resources like a vpc and subnets in a newly created network-stack in lib and instantiated in bin are not showed on pipeline stage.

[solution]: need to cdk deploy --all again



File [network-stack.template.json] does not exist in artifact [Artifact_Source_GitHub_Source]

It looks like if network stack is changed cdk deploy need to be runned again

There are diferences in cdk deploy --all vs cdk deploy --codepipelinesStack, correct way sould be only cdk deploy --codepipelinesStack or commit and push the info to triger the pipeline

--there is a way to automate the cdk synth of the network stack inside codepipelineStack


--Pipeline-stack does not automatically synth network stack when triggered, check buildspec: on the file, research about Cdk Synth process and files/commands involved


--start new repo under this promt

explain again and explain cdk deploy process with an example of creating app.py docker image
